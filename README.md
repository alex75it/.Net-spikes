# Net-spikes

Spikes with C# language and Visual Studio.

## Couchbase

### Test View
This spike is intended for test the advantage to use a View to obtain only specific values of the documents instead of filtering them in C# code.
I want also test the possibility of create a view on Couchbase by code in order to avoid the needs to create it in advance. 
The spike will be initially an exercise on using Couchbase.
